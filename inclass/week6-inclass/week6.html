        <h3>Where the Sidewalk Ends</h3>
        
        <p>There is a place where the sidewalk ends<br>
    and before the street begins,<br>
    and there the grass grows soft and white,<br>
    and there the sun burns crimson bright,<br>
    and there the moon-bird rests from his flight<br>
    to cool in the peppermint wind.</p>
        <p>Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black<br>
    and the dark street winds and bends.<br>
    Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow<br>
    we shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow<br>
    and watch where the chalk-white arrows go<br>
    to the place where the sidewalk ends.</p>
    
        <p>Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,<br>
    and we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,<br>
    for the children, they mark, and the children, they know,<br>
    the place where the sidewalk ends.</p>

        <h3>The Loser</h3>
        
        <p>Mama said I'd lose my head<br>
    If it wasn't fastened on.<br>
    Today I guess it wasn't<br>
    Cause while playing with my cousin<br>
    It fell off and rolled away<br>
    And now it's gone.</p>
    
            <p>And I can't look for it<br>
    Cause my eyes are in it,<br>
    And I can't call to it<br>
    Cause my mouth is on it<br>
    (couldn't hear me anyway<br>
    Cause my ears are on it),<br>
    Can't even think about it<br>
    Cause my brain is in it.<br>
    So I guess I'll sit down<br>
    On this rock<br>
    And rest for just a minute...</p>

        <h3>Warning</h3>
        
        <p>Inside everybody's nose<br>
    There lives a sharp-toothed snail.<br>
    So if you stick your finger in,<br>
    He may bite off your nail.<br>
    Stick it farther up inside,<br>
    And he may bite your ring off.<br>
    Stick it all the way, and he<br>
    May bite the whole darn thing off.</p>

        <h3>Something Missing</h3>
        
        <p>I remember I put on my socks,<br>
    I remember I put on my shoes.<br>
    I remember I put on my tie<br>
    That was printed<br>
    In beautiful purples and blues.<br>
    I remember I put on my coat,<br>
    To look perfectly grand at the dance,<br>
    Yet I feel there is something<br>
    I may have forgotâ€”<br>
    What is it? What is it? . . .</p>
